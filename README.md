# legacyfactor - a mind-breaker about unit testing legacy code

Under src directory you will find examples of bad program designs.
Every example dir is a unique problem.
Your task is refactor the code to make it testable and cover the class (or part of the class) with tests.

Imagine that these classes are part of a big and complex application so **you are not allowed to change
the signatures of methods nor the interfaces of objects** because somewhere itt will break the application.

If needed you can add new classes and methods.

Happy coding!
